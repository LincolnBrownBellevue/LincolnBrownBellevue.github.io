                <h3>Forecasting Prices with Quadratic Model</h3>
                <p>This project explores time-series analysis by modeling daily prices using linear and quadratic regression. The dataset was developed by Zachary M. Jones, who studies the black market for cannabis in the US. The dataset is composed of information pertaining to marijuana where users report the price, quantity, quality, and location of cannabis transactions. The goal is to analyze the variability in prices over time, generate predictions, and test for serial correlation in the data and model residuals. The analysis leverages statistical and visualization tools to assess model performance and interpret results.</p>

                <h3>Predicting Real Estate Prices in Kimball, NE</h3>
                <p>This project aims to predict the sale price of houses in Kimball, NE using features such as size and location. The data was obtained from the Kimball, NE County Assessor's GIS website. The primary object is to gain a better understading of real estate market conditions. A predictive model using publicly available data provides insights into a house's value, assisting in purchasing or selling decisions.</p>

                <h3>Predicting App Usage</h3>
                <p>This project aims to provide actionable insights by identifying key factors associated with app usage time. Key analysis will focus on the correlation between features such as screen-on time, daily data consumption, age, gender, operating system, and device model to determine which factors are most important for predicting app usage time. The target feature for the analysis is the ‘App Usage Time (MB/Day)’ feature. There were three models created for this project, a linear regression model, random forest regression model, and an XGBoost regression model.</p>

                <h3>Phishing Email Detection</h3>
                <p>Emails are a popular platform for attackers to gain access to a network. Using phishing emails, malicious actors harvest user credentials which they can then use to gain access to sensitive information or to impersonate the end user and continue their attack on associated businesses and entities. Phishing emails are a wide-spread business problem and can be a critical vector of attack for data breaches. This project is focused on producing a model that can be used to strengthen phishing detection using models trained on data obtained from Kaggle. This project will develop and evaluate the performance of two models: a Logistic Regression model and a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model.</p>
